In this lab, the first screen shown is the launch screen, featuring the class name, lab name, FAU logo, my name, and Z number. After logging in with an existing account, we are able to see all the shared posts. We then log back out to create a new account and  see that the posts from the previous account are blurred. Next, we made a post from the new account, which unblurred all the posts from the previous account. Lastly, we log back out.
